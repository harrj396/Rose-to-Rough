## Description

 Rose to Rough is wine review application users can see post of many options and variety of wines. The main problem it solves it allows users to signup and login and leave a review of a wine they like.

Project Requirements

You and your group will use everything you’ve learned over the past six modules to create a real-world full-stack application that you’ll be able to showcase to potential employers. The user story and acceptance criteria will depend on the project that you create, but your project must fulfil the following requirements:

Use Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API.

Use Handlebars.js as the template engine.

Use MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database.

Have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.

Use at least one new library, package, or technology that we haven’t discussed.

Have a folder structure that meets the MVC paradigm.

Include authentication (express-session and cookies).

Protect API keys and sensitive information with environment variables.

Be deployed using Heroku (with data).

Have a polished UI.

Be responsive.

Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

Meet good-quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).

Have a professional README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

Presentation Requirements
Use this project presentation template to address the following:

Elevator pitch: a one minute description of your application

Concept: What is your user story? What was your motivation for development?

Process: What were the technologies used? How were tasks and roles broken down and assigned? What challenges did you encounter? What were your successes?

Demo: Show your stuff!

Directions for Future Development

Links to the deployed application and the GitHub repository. Use the Guide to Deploy with Heroku and MySQL on The Full-Stack Blog if you need a reminder on how to deploy to Heroku.

While building this project I learned to:

- Use Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API.
- Use MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database
- Have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.
