# Project Title

## Description

In this order, describe your project: "What is it?" Rose to Rough is wine review application users can see post of other users reviews, "Why did you build it" (not because it was an assignment), "What problem does it solve?" The main problem it solves it allows users to signup and login and leave a review of a wine they like.

While building this project I learned to:

- Use Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API.
- Use MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database
- Have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.
-
